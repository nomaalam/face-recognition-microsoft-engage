# face-recognition-ms-engage
This is my final submission for Microsoft Engage mentorship program 2022.

## About The Project
I have made a facial recognition android app which can recognize the faces of people already stored in the data and also add new faces to the data which can further be used for recogniton.
This means that for adding new faces, we don't need to train the model again. This app simply helps us to add the new faces and save them for further use.
This system of face recognition employed in this project can be used for facial verification in any android app.

## Languages used-
Java

## Pre-trained model used-
[MobileFaceNet](https://github.com/sirius-ai/MobileFaceNet_TF)

## Tools and Frameworks used-
* [ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit)
* [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax)
* [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite)


## Installation-

# Main Project
I would also like to add about the main project that I was working on for Microsoft Engage, which I was unable to complete due to the deprecation of some dependencies that were required in my app. And because of that I had to shift to the face recognition app after a very short amount of time was left but this project can be completed whenever the package continues working.

## About the project
The idea behind the project is to create a mobile app that could detect the facial expression of a person in real time. This app is designed to help the visually-impaired people to get to know about the emotion or expression of the person they are talking to.
I had made a CNN model for emotion detection which was to be integrated with a Flutter app but due to the deprecation of a dependency I was unable to integrate my model in the Flutter app.

Tools and Frameworks used for the model-
* Kaggle
* TensorFlow

Dataset used for training the model-

Tools and Frameworks used for the app-
* Dart
* TensorFlow Lite

Languages used-
